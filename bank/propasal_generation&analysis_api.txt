1. getting started

This document serves as a user or developer guide for Aladdin Wealth's Proposal Generation & Analysis API. The
API enables a caller to send a complete portfolio or household, including positions and other portfolio and
proposal attributes, and returns an optimized proposal(optionally analyzed). It allows third-party applications
to call Aladdin's Proposal Generator to automatically generate an investment proposal. Please note that, while
this document covers the comprehensive suite of capabilities supported by the Proposal Generation & Analysis
API, your firm's specific API integration requirements/access will be reviewed by your Aladdin Wealth
Relationship Manager during the implementation process.




2. change management

Backward compatibility

Aladdin will not:

- remove, rename or change the type of existing fields that are returned in a response.
- remove or rename an existing API endpint.

Aladdin may:

- add new API endpoints. Any newly added endpoint will not change the behavior of the existing endpoints.
- add new optional request parameters or add fileds to objects in the body of a request for existing API
endpoints. If not included, your requests will continue to perform as before. We will use sensible defaults
when optioanal fields are note present.
- add new fileds in API responses. Any newly added fields will not change the meaning of any existing field.
- return new values for existing primitive fields in API responses, including additional enum values.

All such changes are considered "Non-Breaking Changes" and will not increment the API version. The user
should ensure their code handles changes of this nature without the need for a software or configuration
change. All fields in responses should be treated as optianal unless explicitly documented as always present.


3. proposal generation & analysis features

    Investment Proposals(or Proposals) are a critival componnet of Aladdin Wealth. The Proposal API offers a range
of functionalities centered around the creation, analysis, and management of investment proposals

This API suite allows for:

- Stateless portfolio submission to receive an optimized Proposal and its analysis, with an optional
   persistence feature in Aladdin Wealth.
- Stateless Proposal submission (pre-generated) to receive its analysis.
- Retrieval of Proposals and their analysis, previously created the Aladdin Wealth front-end (or via this API)
- Proposal status updates and commentary additions.

This collection comprises of six endpoint which have been covered in detail in the upcoming sections.

1. Generate Proposal (stateless)
2. Generate Proposal Review(stateful)
3. Analyze Proposal (stateless)
4. Get Proposal (stateful)
5. Update Proposal Status (stateful)
6. Get Proposal Latest/Snapshot (with Analysis)(stateful)
7. Update Proposal Supplement (stateful)

Asset Resolution

Before performing analysis on a protfolio or a proposal, its positions must be reconciled against securities in
Aladdin. A single clientId may be used for each position (see Example 1). A clientId is an id provided by the
client as a part of the overnight security master batch process. Alternatively, a set of public security identifiers
may also be used in lieu of a clientId (see Example 2).  Both clientIds and public identifiers may be provided
to maximize the likelihood a match is found.

The API request must provide at least one of the following security identifiers to use for reconciling against
Aladdin. If multiple ids are provided in the request, only one is used for asset resolution. The default order as
shown below and can be configured with the help of your Aladdin Relationship Manager to determine what an
appropriate set of proxies would be.

1. clientId
2. cusip
3. sedol
4. isin
5. ric
6  morningstarSecId
7. wkn
8. valoren

Fallback, "proxy identifiers" may also be provided for any position in the portfolio. These proxy security
identifiers will attempt to match against Aladdin if matching against the primary identifiers was unsucdcessful.
A proxy should have similar characteristics and high correlation with the primary identifiers (i.e. identifiers=
Facebook,proxyIdentifiers=US Tech ETF).

Proposal Generation & Analysis Request and Response headers

Please refer to hte interactive ProposalAPI.v1.html document to see request and response headers.


4. generate proposal

The Generate Proposal endpoint creates an investment proposal given a portfolio using the client specific
guidelines. The request consists of a required aggregate object, which represents a parent entity that consists
of either a single portfolio or a collection of portfolios, optional optimization parameters such as optimization
reason, buy list, and optional analysis settings such as sleeve information and wealth projection settings. This
endpoint returns the original portfolio, proposed portfolio, list of changes and optionally the proposal analysis.
This API is purely stateless, any generated proposals and their analysis will not be persisted within Aladdin Wealth.

Proposal generation is the core function for this endpoint, however, as convenience feature, it offers optional
proposal analysis based on the generated proposal.

Example:
- Generate Proposal Request:
    https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/proposal/v1/generate-proposal
- Generate Proposal Request with Analysis:
    https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/proposal/v1/generate-proposal?includeAnalysis=true

Note: The preferred approach is for clients to send supplement.  sleeveInfo at the aggregate-level because the
endpint will cascade the data down to be avalable for underlying accounts. However, clients can also pass
supplement. sleeveInfo at the account-level, but that data has to be complete because it will NOT be merged
from sleeveInfo at the aggregate account level. Additionally, directly passed account sleeveInfo will NEVER
be available when analyzing the aggregate.

Samples

For sample requests and responses please refer to the interactive ProposalAPI.v1.html document.



5. analyze proposal

The analyze proposal endpint accepts an Investment Proposal, which is a comprised of an original portfolio. a
proposed portfolio and changes details (like which tax lots are disposed in a sell trade). The output is a
complete analysis

Example:
    https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/proposal/v1/analyze-proposal

Note: The preferred approach is for clients to send supplement.sleeveInfo at the aggregate-level because the
endpoint will cascade the data down to be available for underlying accounts. However, clients can also pass
supplement.sleeveInfo at the account-level, but that data has to be complete because it will NOT be merged
from sleeveInfo at the aggregate and account level. Additionally, directly passed account sleeveInfo will NEVER
be available when analyzing the aggregate.

Samples

For sample requests and responses please refer to the interactive ProposalAPI.v1.html document.


6. retrieve proposal

The retreve proposal GET endpoint accepts a proposal id and returns a proposal, its workflow status and
optionally its analysis.

Example:

- https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/proposal/v1/proposals/{id}
- https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/proposal/v1/proposals/{id}?includeAnalysis=true


Samples

For sample requests and responses please refer to the interactive ProposalAPI.v1.html document.



7. retrieve proposal with analysis

The retrieve proposal GET endpoint accepts a proposal id and analysisId and returns a proposal, and its
analysis. The response is returned ONLY for the most recent analysisId and failed for all others.

Example:

- https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/proposal/v1/proposals/{id}/analysis/{analysisId}


Samples

- For sample requests and responses please refer to the interactive ProposalAPI.v1.html document.


8. update proposal status

The update proposal status POST endpoint accepts a proposal id and request body to update the status of the proposal.

Example:

- https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/proposal/v1/{proposals/{id}/status

Samples

For sample requests and responses please refer to the interactive ProposalAPI.v1.html document.


9. update proposal supplement

The update Proposal Supplement PUT endpoint accepts a proposal id and request body to update the
supplemental data of the proposal.

Example:

- https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/proposal/v1/proposals/{id}/supplement


Samples

For sample request and responses pelase refer to the interactive ProposalAPI.v1.html document.


=================================================
endpoint testing

Any of the above end points can be tested by using the appropriate request body and valid authentication.
Authentication details will be provided by your Aladdin Wealth Relationship Manager once the initial setup is
complete. A sample post body will also be provided which can be tested using the Postman app.
