1. getting started

This document serves as a user or developer guide for Aladdin Wealth's Proposal Generation & Analysis API. The
API enables a caller to send a complete portfolio or household, including positions and other portfolio and
proposal attributes, and returns an optimized proposal(optionally analyzed). It allows third-party applications
to call Aladdin's Proposal Generator to automatically generate an investment proposal. Please note that, while
this document covers the comprehensive suite of capabilities supported by the Proposal Generation & Analysis
API, your firm's specific API integration requirements/access will be reviewed by your Aladdin Wealth
Relationship Manager during the implementation process.




2. change management

Backward compatibility

Aladdin will not:

- remove, rename or change the type of existing fields that are returned in a response.
- remove or rename an existing API endpint.

Aladdin may:

- add new API endpoints. Any newly added endpoint will not change the behavior of the existing endpoints.
- add new optional request parameters or add fileds to objects in the body of a request for existing API
endpoints. If not included, your requests will continue to perform as before. We will use sensible defaults
when optioanal fields are note present.
- add new fileds in API responses. Any newly added fields will not change the meaning of any existing field.
- return new values for existing primitive fields in API responses, including additional enum values.

All such changes are considered "Non-Breaking Changes" and will not increment the API version. The user
should ensure their code handles changes of this nature without the need for a software or configuration
change. All fields in responses should be treated as optianal unless explicitly documented as always present.
