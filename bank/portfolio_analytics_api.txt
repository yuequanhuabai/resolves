2.getting started

This document serves as a user or developer guide for Aladdin Wealth's Portfolio API. The API enables
a caller to perform a complete analysis of a portfolio using BlackRock's proprietary Aladdin technology and risk
models. Please note that, while this document covers the comprehensive suite of capabilities supported by the
Portfolio Analytics API, your firm's specific API integration requirements/access will be reviewed by your Aladdin
Wealth Relationship Manager during the implementation process.





3. change management

Backward compatibility

Aladdin will not:

- remove ,rename or change the type of existing fields that are returned in a response.
- remove or rename an existing API endpoint.

Aladdin may:

- add new API endpoint. Any newly added endpoint will not change the behavior of the existing endpoints.
- add new optional request parameters or add fields to objects in the body of a request for existing API
  endpoints. If not included, your requests will continue to perform as before. We will use sensible
  defaults when optional field are not present.
- add new fields in API responses. Any newly added fields will not change the meaning of any existing field.
- return new values for existing primitive fields in API responses, inluding additional enum values.


All such changes are considered "Non-Breaking Changes" and will not increment the API version. The user
should ensure their code handles changes of this nature without the need for a software or configuration
change. All fields in responses should be treated as optional unless explicitly documented as always present.



4. portfolio analytics features

The capability to provide a wide-ranging, deep analysis on a portfolio is a primary Aladdin Wealth feature. The
Portfolio Analytics API enables a business partner to provide a stateless portfolio, consisting of a representative
set of minimal data points (e.g. positions, currency,optinal portfolio attributes,etc.) and to receive back a set of
rich analytics for the portfolio. This collection comprises of two endpoints which have been covered in detail in
the upcoming sections.

1. Total Portfolio Analysis
2. Bulk Portfolio Risk


Asset Resolution

Before performing analysis on a portfolio, its positions must be reconciled against securities in Aladdin. A
single clientId may be used for each position (see Example 1). A clientId is an id provided by the client as a
part of the overnight security master batch process. Alternatively, a set of public security identifiers may also
be used in lieu of a clientId (see Example 2). Both clientIds and public identifiers may be provided to maximize
the likelihood a match is found.

The API request must provide at least one of the following security identifiers to use for reconciling against
Aladdin. If multiple ids are provided in the reqeust, only one is used for asset resolution. The default order as
shown below and can be configured with the help of your Aladdin Relationship Manager to determine what an
appropriate set of proxies would be.

1. clientId
2. cusip
3. sedol
4. isin
5. ric
6. morningstarSecId
7. wkn
8. valoren

FAllback, "proxy identifiers" may also be provided for any opsition in the portfolio. These proxy security
identifiers will attemp to match against Aladdin if matching against the primary identifiers was unsuccesssful.
A proxy should have similar characteristics and high correlation with the primary identifiers(i.e. identifiers=
Facebook, proxyIdentiers=US Tech ETF).


Protfolio Analytics Headers

Pelase refer to the interactive PortfolioAnalyticsAPI.v1.html document to see reqeust and response header.



5.total portfolio analysis

The Total Portfolio Analysis endpoint analyzes a portfolio and , optionally, its benchmark. This endpoint returns
the complete set of portfolio, benchmark and active analytics. Apartner can reqeust a single portfolio analytic
or a collection of analytics defined in the next section. There is also the ability to request analytics for multiple
portfolios at once.

Example:
- Reqeust all analytics:
    https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/analysis/v1/total-portfolio?analytics-ALL
- Request a subset of analytics:
    https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/analysis/v1/total-portfolio?analytics-RISK,POSITION_RISK_CONTRIB,TAIL_RISK
- Request analytics for multiple portfolios(up to 5):
    https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/analysis/v1/total-portfolios?analytics-ALL

Portfolio Analytics Parammeters

The total portfolio endpoints accept the following analytic enums but are enabled on a case-by-case basis.
Discuss with your Alddin Wealth Relationship Manager which analytics may be required.

ALL - Returns all available analytics for the business partner.
RISK - REturns total portfolio risk
POSITION_RISK_CONTRIB - Returns position contributors to risk
FACTOR_RISK-CONTRIB - Returns factor contributors to risk
TAIL_RISK - Returns portfolio expected shortfall and HVaR
LEVERAGE - Returns leverage analytics
SCENARIOS - Returns portfolio PNL during pre-configured breakdown sectors
BREAKDOWNS - Returns portfolio exposures to pre-configured breakdown sectors
CHARACTERISTICS - Returns portfolio characteristics like duration and yield
SIMULATED_PERFORMANCE - Returns performance analytics based on simulated portfolio returns
WEALTH_PROJECTIONS - Returns projected future portfolio values based on client-defined capital market assumptions
RULES - Evaluates and returns client-defined portfolio suitability rules
SCORES - Returns the client-defined Portfolio Quality Score based on Aladdin analytics
CERDIT_RISK - Returns calcalated security level and portfolio level credit risk
ESG - Returns ESG metrics
CUSTOM_ANALYTICS -Returns configured custom calculations or analytics against the portfolio
LIQUIDITY - Returns liquidity analytics.


Samples

For sample requests and responses please refer to the interactive PortfolioAnalyticsAPI.v1.html document.




5.total portfolio analysis

The Total Portfolios Analysis endpoint analyzes a list of portfolios (the limit is currently set to 5) and has the
same functionalities as the Total Portfolio Analysis endpoint. This endpoint returns a list of complete set of
portfolio, benchmark and active analytics in the same order as they are sent.

Example:

- Reqeust all analytics:
    https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/analysis/v1/total-portfolios?analytics-ALL

- Request a subset of analytics:
    https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/analysis/v1/total-portfolios?analytics-RISK,POSITION_RISK_CONTRIB,TAIL_RISK

Samples

For sample reqeust and responses please refer to the interactive PortfolioAnalyticsAPI.v1.html document.


6. bulk portfolio risk

The bulk portfolio risk endpoint is a stateless endpoint that takes a set of portfolios and their positions and
returns each portfolio's total risk only. It is optimized to handle a large set of portfolios that have similar holdings.
The typical usage is to simulate a model rebalance case across all the client accounts tracking that model.

The user will have to be aware of the boundaries when using this API to avoid failed calls. For example, if the total
number of securities increases, the suer may have to break the reqeust into multiple batches.

The limitations of this endpoint are  as listed below:

1. It will return the total risk of each portfolio only. No other analytics are returned, nor can it be configured to return them.
2. It only takes weights for holdings (marketValues are not accepted).
3. It will not be enhanced and no new input or analytic will be supported. Should the client initially use
    this endpoint only to experience a change of requirements that demanded, for example, more analytics,
    the only solution would be to entirely abandon its usage in favor of one of the other endpoints.

This endpoint also has a higher latency compared to other endpoints. For the most common request type
consisting of 500 cusips, 2500 portfolios the average latency is around 25 seconds. The guideline to use the bulk
portfolio risk for a range of securities/portfolios are as laid out below

Number of securities               Numbe of portfolios
0- 500                              <= 2500
500-1500                            <=250


Example:

- https://<client>.blackrock.com/api/aladdinwealth/analysis/v1/bulk-portfolio-risk
