Unix I/O

All I/O devices, such as network,disks, and terminals,are modeled as files,
and all input and output is performed by reading and writing the appropriate fiels.
This elegant mapping of devices to files allows the Linux I/O, that enables all input
and output to be performed in a uniform and consistent way:

Opening files:
The kernel keeeps track of all information about the open file.
The application only keeps track of the descriptor.

descriptor:
0 standard input
1 standard output
2 standard error


Changing the current file position
an applicatin can set the current file position k explicitly by performing a seek operation

Reading and writing files.

The kernel maintain a file position k ,initally 0, for each open file.
