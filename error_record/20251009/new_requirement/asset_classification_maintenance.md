This page  provides a step-by-step demonstration, designed for related parties e.g. PVB IC Teams /FFI/
SSI / WSI to maintain Asset Classification for products in scope.

The process follows a maker-checker model, where users (makers) initiate and edit Asset Classification
changes, and designated approver (checkers) review and confirm the updated before they are finalized.

The maintenance also serves to:
- Assign unrated bonds to the correct asset classification, which the investment grade /non-investment
  grade flag is sourced from TAP
- Update the asset classification of alternative investments, which are stored in FMS

 Please note: the final UI layout and frontend settings are TO BE CONFIRMED and may be 
 subject to further updates.
