In this lesson, we're going to talk about the specific things that are
unique to mobile apps that make it different from the web server
apps that we looked at before.

In the previous section, we learned about the authorization code flow
in OAuth and how it works in a web server environment.

And if you remember back to that section, one of the last parts in that
step was using a client secret to exchange the authorization code for an access token.

Now, in a mobile app, you might be wondering, well, why can't we just do the same thing?

It turns out that it's actually not safe to include client secrets in mobile apps.

If you were to include a client in a mobile app, you would be incuding in the source code,
compiling it, putting that into the App Store, and then everybody would be downloading it.

That means everybody would have a copy of the client secret.

And there are plenty of tools available to decompliled binaries that are shipped on the App Store,
and then that client secret, so it's not really secret anymore. So why do we have it at all?

And it turns out that's exactly how we're going to fix this with mobile apps.

We're just going to not use a client secret.

There are a few other things unique to the mobile app environment, which we're going to
cover in the next two lessons.
