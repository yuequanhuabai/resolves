In the next two lessons, we're going to focus on OAuth from the point of view of creating
OAuth clients. Remember, client is a spec term for application, but specifically it's the
application, but specifically it's the application that's going to be getting and using an
access Token to make API requests.

We'll cover the different kinds of environments applications might be running in, such as
web server apps, or apps on a mobile phone, single-page JavaScript apps, or apps running
on devices that don't have a borwser like an Apple TV, as well as apps they don't even have
an end user.

We'll end the section by touching on some OpenID Connect concepts, highlighting the differences
between OAuth and OpenID Connect. Each section will start with some background on the issues unique
to that particular kind of application. And we'll walk through then a complete example of how to use
the appropriate flow for the situation.

There will also be an exercise or demo so you can see a real example in action.

What I do want to point out about these next few sections is that we'll be focusing on the things
relevant to client developers, mostly ignoring things that only the OAuth server needs to worry
about.

For example, we won't be talking much about access token lifetimes, since as a client developer,
your don't really get any choice in that matter.

The OAuth server makes those decisions for you and you have to take what you get.

Once we get into later sections we'll move in to talking about things from the point of view of
building APIs where we will get into things like the details of token formats and all the
concerns of backend API implementations.

So that out of the way.

Let's get started and I will see you in the next lesson.
